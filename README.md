Goctapus is a wrapper around Echo that makes it easier to build REST APIs and applications that are based on them.

This repository was originaly a fork of [ezynda3/go-echo-vue](https://github.com/ezynda3/go-echo-vue) but it is now using MySQL instead of SQLite3 for the Database and it's purpose is to abstract as many things as possible to make the development of web applications as fast and easy as possible.
